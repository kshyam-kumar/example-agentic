ISSUE DETECTED: Pod default/crash-loop
Status: Waiting: CrashLoopBackOff - back-off 5m0s restarting failed container=looper pod=crash-loop_default(7a16586a-633d-41e1-9ff5-1bdf3a932f4d)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POD LOGS:
Crashing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI ANALYSIS:
**1. Steps leading up to the error:**

* The pod was scheduled to launch and run for 10 minutes.
* It was assigned the default node.
* The pod started successfully and completed the initialization process.

**2. Error:**

* The pod is stuck in the `CrashLoopBackOff` state.

**3. Cause of the error:**

The pod is stuck in the `CrashLoopBackOff` state because it is unable to launch a container because it is waiting for the node to be ready. This is because the node is not ready to receive traffic.

**4. Steps to resolve the issue:**

* Investigate the reason why the node is not ready.
* Check the node logs for any errors or warnings.
* Verify that the node meets the prerequisites for the pod.
* If the node is not ready, consider increasing the `initialDelaySeconds` or `restartPolicy`.
* If the node is ready, check the status of the container in the pod.
* If the container is stuck, consider scaling the pod up to increase the number of replicas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POD LOGS:
No logs available
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI ANALYSIS:
**1. Steps occurred before the error:**

* The pod was scheduled to start at **Tue, 13 May 2025 22:04:08 +0530**.
* It was in a **waiting state** and had not started running yet.

**2. Error:**

* The pod is experiencing an **Error** with exit code **1**.
* The error message indicates that the container encountered a **CrashLoopBackOff** error.

**3. Cause of the error:**

* The **CrashLoopBackOff** error is typically caused by a problem with the container's resources, such as memory or CPU limits being exceeded.  
* The logs indicate that the pod was unable to allocate any resources to the container, leading to a deadlock situation.

**4. Practical steps to resolve the issue:**

* Check the resource requirements of the container and ensure that it has enough memory and CPU available.
* Review the logs for any other error messages or warnings related to resource allocation.
* Inspect the pod's configuration and ensure that it is running with the correct number of replicas.
* If the issue persists, consider increasing the resource allocation or increasing the number of pods in the pod.
* Investigate the root cause of the resource bottleneck and address it to prevent future occurrences.

POD LOGS:
Crashing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI ANALYSIS:
**1. Steps occurred before the error:**

* The pod was scheduled to start at 22:04:40.
* It was in a pending state, waiting to be scheduled.
* The container was running the `looper` image.

**2. Error:**

* The pod crashed with the error message "Crashing".

**3. Cause of the error:**

* The error was caused by a crash loop in the container.
* The `looper` image is known to have a bug that causes it to enter a crash loop under certain conditions.

**4. Practical steps to resolve the issue:**

* Check the logs of the container to see if there is any more information about the crash.
* Identify the specific conditions that trigger the crash loop.
* Fix the underlying issue in the `looper` image to prevent it from entering a crash loop.
* If the bug is fixed in the `looper` image, consider creating a new image based on the patched image.
* Alternatively, if it's not feasible to fix the image, you can try increasing the timeouts for the pod and container to prevent them from crashing.

AI ANALYSIS:
**1. Steps occurred before the error:**

- The pod was scheduled to start on **Wed, 21 May 2025 07:49:03 +0530**.
- The pod was in a **Ready** state with **89 containers ready to start**.
- The pod was configured to run a command `sh -c exit 1` with **no environment variables**.

**2. Error:**

- The pod failed to start with the error message: **"Error"**.

**3. Cause of the error:**

- The error indicates an **unhandled exception** within the pod. The pod logs show the container exited with code 1, indicating an error.       

**4. Practical steps to resolve the issue:**

- Review the pod logs for any hints about the exception.
- Check the container logs for any similar errors.
- Verify that the container is running the correct command and that the required environment variables are set.
- Check the node logs for any related errors or warnings.
- Investigate the cause of the exception and address it accordingly.
- Consider adding a crash handler to the container image to catch and handle exceptions during startup.
